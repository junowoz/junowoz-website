Computer Engineering and Economics student with experience in Software Development mainly using Front-End technologies. I am currently delving into:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS and VueJS.
- SQL, MongoDB and NodeJS.
- Solidity and EthersJS.
- Agile software development methodologies (Kanban & GTD).
- App prototyping with Figma.
- Design thinking.
- Open Source contribution.
- Git & Github.

I'm deeply interested in Blockchain Engineering and Cryptoeconomics, so I'm on track with learning more about ethers.js and Smart Contracts with Solidity.
