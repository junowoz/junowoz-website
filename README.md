Computer Engineering and Economics student with experience in Software Development. I am currently delving into:

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript and ReactJS.
- MongoDB, NodeJS and SQL.
- Solidity and EthersJS.
- Agile software development methodologies (Kanban & GTD).
- App prototyping with Figma and Design Thinking.
- Open Source contribution.
- Git & Github.

I'm deeply interested in Blockchain Engineering and Cryptoeconomics, so I'm on track with learning more about Ethers.js and Smart Contracts with Solidity.
